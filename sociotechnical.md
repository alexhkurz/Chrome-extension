## Action Research Program

Kurt Lewin's work on action research had a significant influence on Eric Trist's development of the action research approach in the context of sociotechnical systems. Lewin, a social psychologist, is often credited with coining the term "action research" in the 1940s and establishing its key principles.

Lewin conceived of action research as a way to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and to involve researchers and practitioners in a collaborative process of problem-solving and social change. He emphasized the importance of involving people in the research process, both as subjects and as active participants in planning and implementing changes.

Trist, who was a prominent figure in the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in the UK, drew upon Lewin's ideas in developing his own approach to action research in the study of sociotechnical systems. Some of the key influences of Lewin's work on Trist's approach include:

1. Collaborative problem-solving: Like Lewin, Trist emphasized the importance of researchers and practitioners working together to identify problems and develop solutions. This collaborative approach was central to Trist's vision of action research in sociotechnical systems.
2. Iterative process: Lewin described action research as a cyclical process of planning, action, and evaluation. This iterative approach was also a key feature of Trist's action research, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation as the research progressed.
3. Dual focus on research and action: Lewin saw action research as a way to generate both scientific knowledge and practical solutions to social problems. Similarly, Trist's approach aimed to produce both theoretical insights and practical improvements in the design and management of sociotechnical systems.
4. Empowerment and social change: Lewin's action research was motivated by a desire to promote social change and empower communities to shape their own circumstances. Trist shared this emancipatory vision, seeing action research as a means of enabling organizations and workers to design more effective and equitable sociotechnical systems.

While Trist adapted and extended Lewin's ideas to the specific context of sociotechnical systems, the fundamental principles of collaboration, iteration, and the integration of research and action remained central to his approach. 

It is worth noting that the influence between Lewin and Trist was not unidirectional. The Tavistock Institute's work on sociotechnical systems and action research also influenced the development of action research more broadly, contributing to its application in a wide range of contexts beyond organizational settings.

Trist's action research approach emphasizes the following key elements:

1. Joint optimization: The goal is to optimize both the social and technical aspects of the system simultaneously, rather than focusing on one at the expense of the other. This requires a holistic understanding of the system and the interdependencies between its social and technical components.
2. Participatory design: The action research approach involves active participation and collaboration between researchers and members of the organization or community under study. This ensures that the research is grounded in the real-world experiences and perspectives of those who are directly involved in the system.
3. Iterative process: Action research is an iterative process of problem identification, planning, action, and evaluation. This allows for continuous learning and adaptation as the research progresses, with insights from each cycle informing the next.
4. Dual focus on theory and practice: The action research approach aims to generate both theoretical knowledge and practical solutions. Researchers work to develop and refine theories about sociotechnical systems while also applying these insights to address concrete problems and improve system performance.
5. Emancipatory potential: Trist saw action research as a means of empowering organizations and communities to shape their own sociotechnical systems. By engaging in collaborative research and design, participants can develop the knowledge and skills needed to create more effective and equitable systems.

## History of Participatory Design

Participatory Design (PD) has its roots in the 1970s and has since evolved into a well-established approach to designing systems, products, and services in collaboration with the people who will use or be affected by them. The history of PD can be traced through several key phases and influential projects:

1. Scandinavian origins (1970s-1980s):
   - PD emerged in Scandinavia, particularly in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, as part of the "workplace democracy" movement. Projects like the Norwegian Iron and Metal Workers' Union (NJMF) project (1970-1973) and the UTOPIA project (1981-1985) in Sweden aimed to involve workers in the design of new technologies for their workplaces.
   - These early PD projects emphasized the importance of democratic participation, skill development, and the protection of workers' interests in the face of technological change.
   
2. Expansion and diversification (1980s-1990s):
   - During this period, PD spread beyond Scandinavia and was applied in various contexts, such as healthcare, education, and community development.
   - Projects like the Florence project (1983-1987) in the US focused on involving nurses in the design of hospital information systems, while the MUST project (1990-1994) in Denmark developed methods for participatory design in government organizations.
   - PD also began to intersect with other fields, such as human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), leading to the development of new methods and tools for collaborative design.

3. Consolidation and critique (1990s-2000s):
   - As PD gained wider recognition, researchers and practitioners worked to consolidate its methods, principles, and theoretical foundations. Books like "Design at Work" (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991) and "Participatory Design: Principles and Practices" (Schuler & Namioka, 1993) helped to establish PD as a distinct approach.
   - At the same time, critical reflections on PD emerged, questioning issues like power relations, the sustainability of participation, and the challenges of scaling PD to larger systems and organizations.

4. Contemporary developments (2000s-present):
   - In recent years, PD has continued to evolve and adapt to new contexts and technologies. Researchers have explored the use of PD in areas such as sustainable design, urban planning, and the design of digital public services.
   - New methods and tools have been developed to support PD in distributed and online settings, such as the use of social media and crowdsourcing platforms.
   - There has also been a growing emphasis on the political and ethical dimensions of PD, with researchers examining issues like the inclusion of marginalized groups, the role of PD in social movements, and the responsibilities of designers in shaping technology and society.

Participatory Design (PD) researchers are often housed in a variety of academic departments, Computer Science and Informatics, Design, Communication and Media Studies, Anthropology and Sociology, Business and Management, Art and Humanities.

## Action Research and Participatory Design

The action research approach developed by Eric Trist and the Tavistock Institute has had a significant influence on the development of Participatory Design (PD). While PD emerged as a distinct approach with its own methods and principles, it shares some key commonalities with Trist's action research, particularly in terms of its emphasis on collaboration, empowerment, and the integration of research and action.

Here are some of the key ways in which Trist's action research has influenced and intersected with Participatory Design:

1. Focus on participation: Trist's approach to action research in sociotechnical systems involved collaboration between researchers and members of the organization or community under study, a principle that is central to PD as well.
2. Empowerment and democratization: Trist saw action research as a means of empowering organizations and workers to shape their own sociotechnical systems. Similarly, PD is driven by a commitment to democratizing the design process and giving voice to the needs and perspectives of users and stakeholders.
3. Iterative and reflective process: The iterative nature of action research, with its cycles of planning, action, and evaluation, has influenced the development of PD methods and practices. 
4. Dual focus on research and action: Like action research, PD aims to generate both knowledge and practical solutions. 
5. Contextual and situated approach: Design solutions must be tailored to the unique needs, practices, and cultural contexts of the people and communities involved.

Despite these commonalities, PD has also drawn upon a range of other influences and traditions beyond action research, such as user-centered design, anthropology, and critical theory. PD has developed its own distinct methods and tools, such as participatory workshops, co-design sessions, and the use of scenarios and prototypes to facilitate collaboration and envision future possibilities.

## History of HCI

1. Early years (1960s-1970s):
   - HCI emerged as a field in the 1960s and 1970s, with the development of early computer systems and the need to make them more accessible and usable for a wider range of users.
   - During this period, HCI focused primarily on ergonomics and human factors, studying how people interacted with computer hardware and software interfaces.

2. Cognitive science influence (1970s-1980s):
   - In the 1970s and 1980s, HCI was heavily influenced by cognitive science, which emphasized the study of mental processes and information processing.
   - Researchers began to apply cognitive models and theories to understand how people perceive, process, and use information when interacting with computers.
   - The concept of "usability" emerged as a key focus, with the goal of designing systems that were easy to learn, efficient to use, and minimized user errors.

3. Rise of graphical user interfaces (1980s-1990s):
   - The 1980s saw the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and the rise of personal computing, which revolutionized the way people interacted with computers.
   - HCI researchers and practitioners focused on designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, using principles from cognitive psychology and visual design.
   - The concept of "user-centered design" gained prominence, emphasizing the need to involve users in the design process and to design for their needs and contexts.

4. Expansion and diversification (1990s-2000s):
   - In the 1990s and 2000s, HCI expanded beyond its original focus on office and productivity applications to encompass a wider range of domains and technologies, such as web design, mobile computing, and ubiquitous computing.
   - New methods and approaches emerged, such as ethnographic studies, participatory design, and user experience (UX) design, which emphasized understanding user needs and contexts through qualitative research and iterative design processes.
   - HCI also began to engage more deeply with social and cultural aspects of technology use, drawing upon fields such as anthropology, sociology, and communication studies.

5. Current trends and future directions (2000s-present):
   - In recent years, HCI has continued to evolve and expand, addressing new challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies such as smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence, and virtual/augmented reality.
   - There has been a growing emphasis on user experience (UX) and designing for emotions, aesthetics, and engagement, beyond just usability and functionality.
   - HCI has also become more interdisciplinary, collaborating with fields such as design, psychology, information science, and computer science to address complex socio-technical challenges.
   - Ethical and social implications of technology have become increasingly important, with HCI researchers and practitioners grappling with issues such as privacy, security, accessibility, and the potential for technology to exacerbate or alleviate social inequalities.

Throughout its history, HCI has been shaped by a range of influences, including technological developments, cognitive science, design, and social science disciplines. It has evolved from a narrow focus on human factors and usability to a broader, more holistic understanding of the complex interactions between people, technology, and society.

## PD and HCI

Participatory Design (PD) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have developed in parallel, with some overlap and interaction between the two fields. However, they have distinct origins and research communities, which have influenced their approaches, methods, and areas of focus.

PD originated in Scandinavia in the 1970s, emerging from the "workplace democracy" movement and the need to involve workers in the design of new technologies for their workplaces. Early PD projects were often driven by a political and social agenda, focusing on issues of power, democracy, and the empowerment of workers in the face of technological change.

In contrast, HCI emerged in the US and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, initially focusing on ergonomics and human factors in the design of computer systems. HCI was more closely aligned with cognitive science and psychology, emphasizing the study of individual users' mental processes and interactions with technology.

Despite these different origins, PD and HCI have increasingly intersected and influenced each other over time:

1. Convergence of interests: As HCI expanded its focus to include social and contextual aspects of technology use, it began to overlap with PD's emphasis on understanding technology in its social and organizational contexts. Similarly, as PD projects began to engage with a wider range of technologies and domains beyond the workplace, they started to draw upon methods and insights from HCI.
2. Mutual influence: PD introduced a range of methods and techniques for involving users and stakeholders in the design process, such as participatory workshops and co-design sessions. These methods have been widely adopted and adapted within HCI, influencing the development of user-centered and collaborative design approaches. Conversely, HCI's focus on usability, user experience, and evaluation has informed the development of PD methods and practices.
3. Shared conferences and publications: PD and HCI researchers have increasingly participated in the same conferences and published in the same journals, facilitating the exchange of ideas and collaboration between the two fields. For example, the Participatory Design Conference (PDC) has become a key venue for HCI researchers interested in PD, while HCI conferences such as CHI (Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) have hosted PD-related workshops and panels.
4. Interdisciplinary collaboration: Both PD and HCI have sought to engage with other disciplines, such as anthropology, sociology, and design, to address the complex social and cultural dimensions of technology. This has led to the formation of interdisciplinary research teams and projects, bringing together researchers and practitioners from PD, HCI, and other fields.

Despite these interactions, PD and HCI have maintained distinct identities and research communities. PD has continued to emphasize its political and ethical commitments, focusing on issues of democracy, empowerment, and social change. HCI, while increasingly engaging with social and ethical issues, has maintained a broader focus on usability, user experience, and the design of effective and engaging interactive systems.

   - Emphasizes directly involving users and stakeholders in the software development process
   - Techniques include participatory design workshops, co-design, and user-driven development

These developments reflect the growing recognition within SE of the importance of human, social, and organizational factors in software development. They demonstrate how insights and approaches from STS, OD, AR, PD, and HCI have been adapted and applied to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and user-centeredness of software engineering practices.

---

The more formal and technical aspects of software engineering (SE), such as specifications, verification, testing, and formal methods, have also been influenced by sociotechnical systems (STS), organization development (OD), action research (AR), participatory design (PD), and human-computer interaction (HCI), albeit to a lesser extent compared to the user-centered and agile approaches mentioned earlier. Here are a few ways in which these fields have influenced formal and technical SE practices:

1. Formal methods and specifications:
   - STS and OD have influenced the way formal methods are applied in practice, emphasizing the need to consider social and organizational factors in addition to technical ones.
   - PD and HCI have contributed to the development of user-centered and scenario-based approaches to formal specifications, such as use case modeling and user interface specification languages.

2. Verification and validation (V&V):
   - AR and PD have influenced the way V&V activities are conducted, promoting the involvement of users and stakeholders in the validation process, such as through user acceptance testing and participatory evaluation.
   - HCI has contributed to the development of usability inspection methods, such as heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs, which can be used to verify and validate user interface designs.

3. Testing:
   - AR and PD have promoted the involvement of users and stakeholders in testing activities, such as through beta testing and user acceptance testing.
   - HCI has influenced the development of usability testing methods, which focus on evaluating the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of user interactions with software systems.

4. Model-based development:
   - STS and OD have influenced the way models are used in software development, emphasizing the need to consider social and organizational aspects in addition to technical ones.
   - PD and HCI have contributed to the development of user-centered modeling approaches, such as user interface modeling and task modeling.

5. Requirements engineering:
   - STS, OD, and AR have influenced the way requirements are elicited and analyzed, emphasizing the need to consider the social and organizational contexts in which software systems will be used.
   - PD and HCI have contributed to the development of user-centered requirements engineering approaches, such as participatory requirements workshops and user story mapping.

While these influences demonstrate some impact of STS, OD, AR, PD, and HCI on formal and technical SE practices, it is important to note that the integration of these fields with the more formal aspects of SE has been relatively limited compared to their influence on user-centered and agile approaches.

This is partly due to the different philosophical and methodological foundations of these fields. Formal methods, verification, and testing tend to emphasize mathematical rigor, objectivity, and the elimination of ambiguity, while STS, OD, AR, PD, and HCI often prioritize subjectivity, interpretation, and the embrace of multiple perspectives.

However, there is a growing recognition within SE of the need to bridge these different approaches and to develop more holistic and socially aware methods that can address both technical and social aspects of software development. This has led to the emergence of interdisciplinary research areas, such as socio-technical systems engineering and human-centered software engineering, which seek to integrate insights and methods from STS, OD, AR, PD, HCI, and other fields with traditional SE practices.

As software systems become increasingly complex, interactive, and embedded in social and organizational contexts, the need for such interdisciplinary approaches is likely to grow. By drawing upon the insights and methods of STS, OD, AR, PD, and HCI, software engineers can develop more robust, user-centered, and socially responsible approaches to specifications, verification, testing, and formal methods.

## Hard vs Soft SE

You raise an important point about the distinction between the more formal and less formal aspects of software engineering (SE). This distinction is indeed significant and has been conceptualized in various ways by SE researchers. Here are some common ways in which this distinction is framed:

1. Hard vs. soft systems thinking:
   - "Hard" systems thinking, associated with the more formal aspects of SE, emphasizes objectivity, quantification, and the use of mathematical and computational models.
   - "Soft" systems thinking, associated with the less formal aspects of SE, emphasizes subjectivity, interpretation, and the consideration of social and human factors.

2. Technical rationality vs. reflective practice:
   - "Technical rationality," associated with the more formal aspects of SE, views software development as a rational, problem-solving process that can be optimized through the application of scientific and engineering principles.
   - "Reflective practice," associated with the less formal aspects of SE, recognizes the inherent complexity and uncertainty of software development and emphasizes the importance of reflection, experimentation, and learning.

3. Positivist vs. interpretivist epistemologies:
   - Positivist epistemologies, associated with the more formal aspects of SE, view knowledge as objective, universal, and based on empirical observation and measurement.
   - Interpretivist epistemologies, associated with the less formal aspects of SE, view knowledge as subjective, contextual, and based on social construction and interpretation.

4. Traditional vs. agile methodologies:
   - Traditional SE methodologies, such as the waterfall model, emphasize a linear, plan-driven approach to software development, with a focus on formal specifications, documentation, and testing.
   - Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and XP, emphasize an iterative, adaptive approach to software development, with a focus on collaboration, flexibility, and customer involvement.

In terms of naming these different fields of SE, there is no universally accepted terminology. However, some common labels include:

- Formal methods, verification, and testing (for the more formal aspects of SE)
- Human-computer interaction, user-centered design, and agile methods (for the less formal aspects of SE)
- Software engineering (as an umbrella term encompassing both formal and less formal aspects)

It's worth noting that many SE researchers and practitioners recognize the importance of both formal and less formal aspects of SE and seek to integrate them in their work. For example, the field of "software engineering for human-computer interaction" (SE4HCI) explicitly seeks to bridge the gap between SE and HCI, drawing upon methods and insights from both fields.

Similarly, the notion of "balanced software engineering" has been proposed as a way to reconcile the tensions between hard and soft systems thinking, technical rationality and reflective practice, and positivist and interpretivist epistemologies. Balanced SE emphasizes the need for a pragmatic, context-dependent approach that draws upon both formal and less formal methods as appropriate.

In summary, while there is a clear distinction between the more formal and less formal aspects of SE, both in terms of methods and communities, there is also a growing recognition of the need to bridge this divide and to develop more holistic and integrated approaches to software development. By drawing upon the strengths of both formal and less formal methods, and by considering the social and human factors that shape software development, SE researchers and practitioners can develop more effective, user-centered, and socially responsible approaches to building software systems.

## Conferences on Hard and Soft SE

Certainly! Here are three flagship conferences that exemplify "hard" (formal) software engineering and three that exemplify "soft" (less formal) software engineering:

Hard SE conferences:

1. International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE):
   - ICSE is the premier conference in software engineering, covering a wide range of topics related to the theory and practice of SE.
   - It has a strong emphasis on technical and formal aspects of SE, such as software architecture, testing, verification, and automation.

2. International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM):
   - FM is a leading conference focused on the theory and application of formal methods in software development.
   - It covers topics such as formal specification, verification, model checking, and theorem proving.

3. International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE):
   - ASE is a major conference focused on the automation of software development processes, including analysis, design, implementation, and testing.
   - It emphasizes the use of formal methods, tools, and techniques to improve the efficiency, reliability, and quality of software systems.

Soft SE conferences:

1. Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI):
   - CHI is the premier conference in human-computer interaction (HCI), covering a wide range of topics related to the design, evaluation, and use of interactive systems.
   - It has a strong emphasis on user-centered design, usability, and the social and human aspects of computing.

2. Participatory Design Conference (PDC):
   - PDC is a leading conference focused on the theory and practice of participatory design, which involves the active involvement of users and stakeholders in the design process.
   - It covers topics such as co-design, user empowerment, and the social and political dimensions of technology design.

3. Agile Conference (Agile):
   - Agile is a major conference focused on agile software development methods, which emphasize collaboration, flexibility, and customer involvement.
   - It covers topics such as Scrum, XP, Kanban, and lean software development, as well as the organizational and cultural aspects of agile adoption.

It's worth noting that these conferences are not exclusively "hard" or "soft" in their focus, and many of them include elements of both formal and less formal SE. For example, ICSE has a track on "Software Engineering in Society," which focuses on the social and human aspects of SE, while CHI has a track on "Engineering Interactive Systems," which focuses on the technical and formal aspects of HCI.

Moreover, there are several conferences that explicitly seek to bridge the gap between hard and soft SE, such as:

- International Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE)
- International Workshop on Software Engineering for HCI (SE4HCI)
- International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE)

These conferences demonstrate the growing recognition within the SE community of the need to integrate insights and methods from both formal and less formal approaches, and to consider the social and human factors that shape software development.

By bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, these conferences contribute to the development of more holistic, interdisciplinary, and socially responsible approaches to software engineering.

## Agile Methods

The history of agile software development can be traced back to the 1990s, when a number of lightweight software development methods began to emerge as alternatives to the dominant waterfall model. These methods, which included Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Crystal, and Feature-Driven Development (FDD), among others, shared a focus on flexibility, collaboration, and customer involvement.

Here's a brief timeline of some key events in the history of agile:

1. 1986: Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka publish "The New New Product Development Game," introducing the idea of "scrum" as a flexible, team-based approach to product development.
2. 1995: Ken Schwaber presents "Scrum Development Process" at the OOPSLA conference, formalizing Scrum as a software development framework.
3. 1996: Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, and Ron Jeffries begin developing Extreme Programming (XP) at Chrysler, emphasizing practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration.
4. 1997: Alistair Cockburn publishes "Surviving Object-Oriented Projects," introducing the Crystal family of lightweight methodologies.
5. 1999: Kent Beck publishes "Extreme Programming Explained," the first book on XP.
6. 2001: The Agile Manifesto is published, articulating the values and principles of agile software development. The manifesto is signed by 17 software developers, including Kent Beck, Alistair Cockburn, Martin Fowler, Ron Jeffries, and Ken Schwaber.
7. 2001: The first Agile Conference is held in Salt Lake City, Utah.
8. 2002: The Agile Alliance is founded as a non-profit organization to promote agile software development.
9. 2005: Scrum Alliance is founded to provide training and certification in Scrum.
10. 2010s: Agile methods continue to gain popularity, with Scrum and XP emerging as the most widely used frameworks. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) are developed to support agile adoption in large organizations.

The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 was a pivotal moment in the history of agile, as it brought together a diverse group of software developers who shared a common vision for a more flexible, collaborative, and customer-focused approach to software development. The manifesto articulated four core values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

These values, along with a set of 12 principles, provided a foundation for the agile movement and helped to establish agile as a mainstream approach to software development.

Since the publication of the Agile Manifesto, agile methods have continued to evolve and mature. Scrum and XP have emerged as the most widely used agile frameworks, while new methods, such as Kanban and Lean, have been developed to address specific challenges and contexts.

The rise of agile has also had a significant impact on the broader field of software engineering, leading to a greater emphasis on collaboration, flexibility, and customer involvement. Many traditional SE practices, such as requirements engineering, testing, and project management, have been adapted to fit within an agile framework.

However, the adoption of agile has not been without its challenges. Some organizations have struggled to implement agile at scale, while others have encountered resistance from stakeholders who are accustomed to more traditional, plan-driven approaches.

Despite these challenges, agile has become a dominant paradigm in software development, and its influence continues to grow. As organizations seek to become more responsive, innovative, and customer-focused, agile methods are likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of software engineering.

## STS, OD, AR, PD, HCI and Agile Methods

Certainly! Here are some references that explicitly show or reflect upon the influence of sociotechnical systems (STS), organization development (OD), action research (AR), participatory design (PD), and human-computer interaction (HCI) on agile methods:
